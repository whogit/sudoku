This is the code for the original PHP project I wrote to solve a Sudoku
puzzle in 2007 when I first started studying LAMP.

The Sudoku_cell.sql can be run to create the database needed.
The config.php is used to store the database credentials.
The sudoku.php is then run from a browser.

Note: It only solves puzzles that you enter.  It does not
give you puzzles that you can then solve.
